# FreeFi

Temp dev notes from Steve:
    - renamed to FreeFi and set the !# bash interpreter line so it will auto-use python when running
        FreeFi like an executable, you might need to chmod +x it if exe bit not set
    - the mac address is changing by itself somehow, seems to change every few minutes, wHAT?
